# Creating a New Wrapped CAT

As a result of many requests from the Chia community, the team has decided to create a process for making new memecoins available for bridging. The bridge team does not take any fees from the deployment process, but the wrapped CAT creator is expected to cover the contract deployment fee on Base. Note that following the steps outlined here does **NOT** guarantee the token will be listed on the official bridge interface - the warp.green team reserves the right to approve/reject pull requests on a case-by-case basis. As such, it's highly recommended to [reach out](contact-us.md) before starting the process.
